# Design Patterns with Typescript

This exercise helps to understand the concept of typescript.

1. Make tsconfig.json with basic properties 1) compilerOptions
2. compilerOptions have the following basic properties (tsconfig.json)
   1. rootDir
   2. outDir
   3. target
   4. module
3. Inside package.json file scripts
   1. If config with dev. npm run dev
   2. If config with start. npm start
4. There is different version of code
   1. In v1 used <strong> enum </strong>
   2. In v2 used class of match inside of string
   3. In v3 the file reader is write separate
   4. In V4 use typescript <strong> tuples </strong>
   5. In V5 use <strong>Solve in Inheritance, Generic </strong>
   6. In v6 use <strong> Solve in composition </strong>
5. In v7 the code is more modules use interface and how can use that interface in classes
6. <strong> Static Method </strong> use in v7

## Available Scripts

### `npm install --global typescript`

Installing the TypeScript Package and tsc --version will show the version of tsc.

### `npm init -y`

It will generate a package json file.

### `tsc --init `

It will generate a tsconfig json file.

1. ### `npm install --save-dev nodemon`

It will install nodemon which is help to fast the development process.

2. ### `npm install concurrently --save-dev`

Run multiple commands concurrently. Like npm run watch-js & npm run watch-less but better.

More help [Concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently)

3. ### `npm install @types/node --save-dev`

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
